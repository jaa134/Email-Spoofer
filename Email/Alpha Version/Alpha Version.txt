Jutin and I worked on this project completly together. We met up one day and completed this assignment.
I was the one typing, while Justin and I both contributed to the design. The difficulties with this 
version was reading from the text files. They proved very difficult to manipulate the strings correctly. 
Additionally, the need for resizing the gui when files are attached was overly complicated. Sending the emails
themselves was suprisingly easy.
